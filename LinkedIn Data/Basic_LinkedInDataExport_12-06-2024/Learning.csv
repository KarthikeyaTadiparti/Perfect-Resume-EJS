Advanced C Programming: Optimize Performance and Efficiency,"Once you've mastered the basics of programming in C, you can concentrate on writing more efficient, more functional code. In this course, Dan Gookin offers some tips to help you extend your C programming skills. Learn how to read and write main function arguments, build more useful variables, and work with arrays and structures. Plus, get tips on generating pointers, and take the practice challenges to test your learning along the way.",Course,N/A,N/A,true,N/A,
C Standard Library,"Get up to speed with the C standard library, the standardized library of functions available for the C programming language. This course covers over 60 of the most useful and popular functions, as grouped in the header files stdio.h, stdlib.h, stdint.h, string.h, and math.h. Instructor Eduardo Corpeño starts by reviewing the library's organization and familiarizing you with the header files and syntax. Then he shows how to accomplish a variety of tasks with the library: processing input and output, managing application memory, generating random numbers, sorting and searching for data, manipulating text strings, and performing math. Each chapter includes numerous examples that show the functions in practice, along with programming challenges that allow you to test your new knowledge and skills.",Course,N/A,N/A,true,N/A,
"C: Data Structures, Pointers, and File Systems","C is a foundational language for a variety of other programming languages, as well as an up-and-coming language for embedded systems. If you’re interested in broadening your knowledge of C, then this course is for you. Join instructor Dan Gookin as he takes a deep dive into data structures, pointers, and other key topics in this essential programming language. Dan digs into a variety of programming concepts such as arrays, structures, characters, and strings. He also goes over pointers—variables that hold a memory location—explaining how to use pointers to manipulate data, do pointer math, and more. He wraps up the course by sharing a few special techniques, including how to solve math puzzles with C.",Course,N/A,N/A,true,N/A,
C Essential Training,"C is as essential as ever. This powerful language lies at the heart of JavaScript and Objective-C and is a popular language for developing embedded systems. This course teaches the fundamentals of programming in C, covering four introductory aspects: code structure, data, program flow, and functions. Instructor Dan Gookin dissects the anatomy of C, shows how data is stored in variables and values, and demonstrates how to use operators to perform math, modify variable values, evaluate expressions, and more. Then you can see how these basic elements fit together in control structures like loops—where the real logic comes into play. Finally, you can learn to use and write functions, the workhorse of the C language, which help accomplish basic and complex tasks in the code, eliminate repetition, and make code more readable. Make sure to take the challenges issued throughout the course to test your new programming skills and compare your solutions with the instructor's.",Course,N/A,N/A,true,N/A,
Advanced C Programming: Integrating C and Assembly Language,"Though a C compiler is efficient, it's possible to work with both C and assembly, enjoying the speed of assembly with the lower development time of C. In this course, instructor Dan Gookin teaches you how to link C and assembly object files, call C functions from assembly code, as well as write assembly inline in a C function. Dan starts by explaining how to acquire an assembler and run C and assembly programs. He discusses how integrating C and assembly language can improve your coding skills and program performance. He walks you through how to create a program in assembly by processing the proper steps: assemble, link, and run. Dan shows you how the compiler translates C instructions into assembly and how to optimize your C code by using assembly to target bottlenecks. He goes over how to join assembly code with C code, as well as how to use C language functions in assembly code. In conclusion, Dan explains how to use assembly functions for C.",Course,N/A,N/A,true,N/A,
"C Programming Basics: Flow Control, Variables, and Pointers","Released in 1973, C is still at the center of it all. In this course, get a quick introduction to the vocabulary and basics of programming in C, the language that inspired C++, Objective-C, and many others. Instructor Dan Gookin covers flow control, variables, and other basic topics, but also introduces advanced concepts such as pointers and memory allocation. Plus, he provides challenges that allow you to test your learning along the way.",Course,2022-12-25 14:14 UTC,N/A,true,N/A,
